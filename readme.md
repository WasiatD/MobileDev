## **Description**
This application was created with Kotlin as the language, and Android Studio as the IDE. This application also uses Machine Learning models to predict plant diseases. This application can also be connected to the API created by the Cloud Computing Developer.

## **Installation**
Following are the steps that must be followed to run this application on your device. Make sure all steps are executed correctly before running the code.

- **Clone Reposistory** <br>

The first step is that you can clone this repository with the following syntax:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/WasiatD/MobileDev.git
```
If you don't have git or similar version control, you can download the zip and then extract it manually to the desired directory.

- **Adjust Dependencies**

Make sure you have adjusted the dependencies according to the version of Android Studio and SDK that you are using. You can check` build.gradle` and `libs.version.toml` to adjust the dependencies.

- **Enjoy!**

Once you've matched your dependencies and library versions to the version of Android Studio you're using, you can `build and run` it. There shouldn't be any problems if you are already at this stage.


## **Feature**
Following are several features of WasiatD that can be used. This feature is still in the development stage and may continue to change over time.

- **Authentication**

In Authentication, users can register using email and password. After that, the user can also log in according to the account that was created previously.

- **Plant Monitoring**

Users can monitor plants that are connected to IOT (Internet of Things). There is a warning on the card on the dashboard when there is an abnormal condition of the plant.

- **To-do List**

Users can also add tasks or to-do lists for the plants they own. It is hoped that this task can be a reminder for users so that the plants remain in good condition.

- **Checking for Plant Diseases**

Users can upload images of the plants they own to check for diseases using Machine Learning Models. Apart from knowing the name of the disease, users will also be given a description of the disease which is connected to Gemini Ai.
